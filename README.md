`LoadedImage` not a hook, but makes sure image is fully loaded before appearing on page

`setState` elminates the need to destructure state that is not being updated

`useEffectOnce` elminates need to add dependency array

`useFetch` good for fetching async data, APIs...

`useLocalStorage` a hook for both getting and setting local storage values

`useCounter` good for cart items

`useDebounce` good for passing e.target.value to state, saves on performance

`useHover` good for hover effects, changing text...

`useRendersCount` quick way to check component rendering

`useInterval` can start and stop intervals, declarative

`useScroll` good for scroll effects

`useToggle` can set to true, false, or toggle

`useWindowSize` easy way of performing media query styling

`useForm` easy way to make forms

`useMap` good for working with maps many times

`useGlobalState` an alternative for useContext without re-rendering child components

`useOnScreen` is good for lazy-loading once in view...
